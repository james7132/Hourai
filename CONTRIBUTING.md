# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to Hourai! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! 😊

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with
- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g.
  screenshots of the bot's behavior)
- **Marketing**: writing howto's, voting for the bot on
  [top.gg](https://top.gg/), ...
- **Translation**: Translating documentation, bot messages, etc. to other
  languages.
- **Documentaion**: Hourai is a complicated bot, improving documentation and
  giving feedback on how the docs are written helps everyone understand and use
  it.
- **Networking**: Expanding Hourai's footprint on Discord, sharing and adding
  the bot with others.
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](issues). Even if you can't write
  code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters.
  It helps us triage them.

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should
explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request
should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?
